    "Looking at the results for **\"men\"** and **\"women\"**, we can see a considerable difference in gender in health  news articles. **women** is mentioned 31 times, whereas **men** is only mentioned 9 times. But even with 9 times, 4 times out of which **\"men\"** goes with **\"and women\"**. This may implies either or all of these:\n",

    "3. Women have more health problems than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, (1) and (3) may be the main reasons for the gender bias in those articles. Indead, women often have more  health issues than men such as pregnancy or breast cancer. Some other usual health problems also affect women primarily or more severely than men. For instance, women are more likely to die following a heart attack than men are (Cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in women: Recent findings), women are more likely to report having stress, and almost 50% of all women in the survey, compared to 39% of the men, said their stress has increased over the past five years (Gender and Stress). For those reasons, it's understandable why news articles mention women more often than men.\n",
